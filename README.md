PageNotes allows you to take notes on webpages, generate MLA citations, and save them for later. Here's how it works:

1.	Download the extension from the Chrome Web Store, available here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iifhdjpcheaoibmbehjbgcnjcfjihfpp
2.	Open a webpage you want to take notes on
3.	Click the PageNotes icon in your Chrome toolbar
4.	An extension pop-up will open where you can take notes regarding the content on that page
5.	Copy & paste the URL of the page you’re on into the URL section of the extension, if not done automatically
6.	Give your note a title and start taking notes
7.	Type in the required information if you would like to generate a citation - for example, author name, website name, etc.
8.	Click "Generate MLA" to create an MLA bibliography citation that you can copy & paste into any document
9.	Click "Save" to keep your notes on-hand for future use
10.	Revisit your notes anytime by clicking the PageNotes icon and choosing the name of the note you’re interested in
11.	Click the red "X" next to the note's name if you are done with a note and no longer need it stored on the extension
